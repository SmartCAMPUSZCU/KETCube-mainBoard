# KETCube mainBoard Original Design Files

This directory contains the original KETCube design files drawn in Altium Designer. 

The development process was partially in-house with release points in the project timeline. 

The meaningful revisions and variants are contained in this directory independently of the current release of the KETCube platform. If you would like to use the latest released and proven board variant, please use the [lates release](https://github.com/SmartCAMPUSZCU/KETCube-mainBoard/releases/latest).
